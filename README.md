# Learning Clojure

### Following the book clojure for the brave and true and playing around with this really cool language. 
### Check out the book here: https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/
### It's outrageous. 

Other than that this is really just a collection of code snippets where I am trying out things with the language and get to learn stuff.
